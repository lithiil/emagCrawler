**The Emag Crawler**

*Disclaimer* 

*This class is only an educational exercise and is not meant to infringe any type of laws.*

The emag crawler class uses simple_html_dom to crawl a category link (provided by you) from emag.ro
and provide relevant results that meet the price range that you set. 

I made this because I find it to be faster than endlessly browsing for something that is in my budget.
You could also use it to stalk for items that go for really low prices (1 Ron) in categories that usually
don't have those prices (like mobile phones, tv screens etc...)

You can provide a path for a txt and it will write the results there, but feel free to integrate it
with whatever you may need (jsons, DBs etc...)
